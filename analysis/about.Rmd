# About: Authors

## Chong Kim

Hi there. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in the School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences. The broad domain of research I'm interested in is pharmacoeconomics, pharmacoepidemiology, and biostatistics. This project has to do a lot with pharmacoepidemiology, biostatistics, and machine learning. Hopefully I'll be able to utilize principles I've learned throughout my coursework to determine if there are any interesting patterns among TTP patients.
